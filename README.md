# LinkListERP
A C++ program to implement ERP system for a class using singly linked list data structure.
This program has been developed on Linux environment and it is recommended to be used on Linux only.
The compiler was GNU/G++.
To start the software, run the object file

In the software, you would see things like (V)iew, (I)nsert, etc. It means to select that option you need to press the key mentioned in the bracketts from the keyboard (and keys are case specific).

After selecting (E)xit option (by pressing 'E' from the keyboard), the contents would be written to the "database" file. It is advised for the security of your data that you do not fiddle with the file.

The file must be there in the same folder as the software for proper working. So, do not move or delete the file as the data would be lost and the software may stop working.

In this software, you can add new record; view, update and remove existing records and count number of records.

When you view the records, they would appear branch wise with ordering by student id within that.

The records you enter, would automatically be stored student id wise. But the software would not prevent you from entering the same student id twice (which should ideally be unique), so enter carefully as student id once stored cannot be changed; and deleting the record would be the only possible option.

To save the data, you must exit by pressing the 'E' key. Terminating the program abruptly would lead to loss of data.
